# Minetest Management Console (1.4.0)
Allows you to manage your Minetest server with a text based GUI -  Official support sites: [Official Github Repo](https://github.com/fstltna/MinetestManagementConsole) - [Official Forum](https://minecity.online/index.php/forum/management-console)

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

Run "mmc". If you need to change any settings after this, edit "~/.mmcrc" and make the desired changes. This can be done within mmc itself.

You also need to have my Minetest Startup Script and Minetest Backup Script installed.

I then suggest you add this directory (MinetestManagementConsole) into your path, so that you can just run "git pull" to upgrade to the latest version mmc as updates come out.
